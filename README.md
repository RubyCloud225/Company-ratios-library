Overview
This repository includes tools for valuing both private and public companies. We focus on fundamental methods such as Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Comparable Company Analysis (CCA), Precedent Transactions Analysis (PTA), and Market Capitalization (for public companies).

Valuation Methods
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The DCF method values a company by estimating its future cash flows and discounting them to the present value using a discount rate, typically the company's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). This approach is applicable to both private and public companies.
